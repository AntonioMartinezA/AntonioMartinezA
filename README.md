Hi, Iâ€™m @AntonioMartinezA I'm a math and computer sciences student, I'm self-learning AI using Kaggle and Coursera. I don't use GitHub for my projects but you can see them on these google collab links:

Birds Classifier https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wiUGGRh9xI9zf1rC_30p0_Xm5wKyQe1t?usp=sharing

Titanic Kaggle problem https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e5btHyxvc670bLgI3ano1xyC3GA5ahzP?usp=sharing

Face parts detector https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lzf1JSjvXv8V0vOWUlQUZgYZBBI8QlyO?usp=sharing

I did these before completing the deep learning specialization, I'm currently working on adding a couple of projects to show what I learned
